              <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
              <p>
                refers to any information that identifies or can be used to
                identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information
                pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone
                number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social
                security number, and credit card information. Personally
                Identifiable Information does not include information that is
                collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the
                individual user) or demographic information not connected to an
                identified individual.
              </p>
              <h4>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</h4>

              <p>
                We may collect basic user profile information from all of our
                Visitors. We collect the following additional information from
                our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers
                and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size
                of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising
                inventory that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or
                sell.
              </p>
              <h4>What organizations are collecting the information?</h4>
              <p>
                In addition to our direct collection of information, our third
                party service vendors (such as credit card companies,
                clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as
                credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this
                information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do
                not control how these third parties use such information, but we
                do ask them to disclose how they use personal information
                provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of
                these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as
                links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or
                use the information given to them.
              </p>

                than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the Authorized
                Customer off.

                Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with
                law. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in
                order to comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from
                a law enforcement agency to release information. We will also

                How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information
                secure?
              </h4>
              <p>
                All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and
                practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our
                Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a
                limited number of qualified employees who are given a password
                in order to gain access to the information. We audit our
                security systems and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive
                information, such as credit card numbers or social security
                numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to
                protect information sent over the Internet. While we take
                commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site,
                electronic communications and databases are subject to errors,
                tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that
                such events will not take place and we will not be liable to
                Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences.

                How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally
                Identifiable Information?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update
                Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any
                inaccuracies by emailing us at

              <h4>
                Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable

              <p>
                We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to
                delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the
                Site's database by contacting . However, because of backups and
                records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's
                entry without retaining some residual information. An individual
                who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information
                deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and
                we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable
                Information relating to that individual in any way moving
                forward.

              <h4>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</h4>
              <p>
                We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about
                changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the
                Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner
                that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable
                Information that a Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously
                requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor or
                Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer
                to prevent such disclosure.
